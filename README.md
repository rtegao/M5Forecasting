\*\* Git repository for forecasting analysis, based on kaggle competition.

The main idea it's to build forecasting system for more tham 30K diferensts products, 
located in 3 differents states (CA,TX and WI). But lets start with three differents products, one hobbie product (ForecastHobbie),
one food product (ForecastFood) and one house hold product (ForecastHouseHold).

In this three basics notebooks, I'll try to predict 28 time steps in the future using more the one input feature, with LSTM models. 

After try to predict just three products separately, I'll try to do all together (SimpleSystem).
